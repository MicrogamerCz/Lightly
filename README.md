# Lightly flatpak

**This isn't the flatpak-focused Lightly fork...?**\
Exactly. As much as I love Lightly, it has been mostly dead. Original lightly is dead, because [Luwx](https://github.com/Luwx/Lightly) disappeared and hasn't returned, [Boehs](https://github.com/boehs/Lightly) doesn't have a working Linux machine (which is strange, considering Qt is a cross-platform framework... whatever), and while it is still maintained by [xuzhao9](https://github.com/xuzhao9/Lightly), arguably most contributors moved towards Darkly and I am moving in this direction as well.\
Lightly is very unlikely to have major changes in its codebase, so I will keep updating the manifests in this tiny repo instead and they should (hopefully) work without hitches. At least until Qt 7.0\
These *light* updates and/or possible API changes are the only two reasons why I won't archive this repo.
